          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            From New Jersey, I am a sophomore at the University of Maryland, College Park, pursuing a double major in the Cybersecurity track of Computer Science as well as Mathematics.
            I am actively involved in research through the First-Year Innovation and Research Experience (FIRE) program, where I now serve as a Peer Mentor for the Climate Computing stream.
          </p>
          <p>
            My academic work emphasizes algorithms, computer systems, and applied security, and I supplement coursework with Capture the Flag competitions and technical projects in authentication systems and AI/ML.
          </p>
          <p>
            I intend to build a career in cybersecurity with a focus on vulnerability analysis, penetration testing, and applied cryptography. My goal is to work on security challenges in both enterprise and research-driven environments, combining software engineering expertise with security best practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of academics and cybersecurity, I enjoy participating in hackathons and building side projects that combine software, hardware, and security. I am also passionate about exploring emerging technologies and technical problem-solving.
