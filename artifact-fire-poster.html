      <h1>FIRE Climate Computing Research Poster</h1>
      <p>
        A team research poster that examines how January and February cyclone tracks relate to Arctic sea ice loss using CESM simulations.

        <h2>Context and purpose</h2>
        <p>
          This poster comes from my work in the FIRE Climate Computing stream, where our team investigated how the geographic position of Arctic storm tracks affects subsequent sea ice change.
          Using the Community Earth System Model with the GIAF component set and COREv2 forcing, we simulated three winter storm events and compared sea ice variables over a twelve month window against a long term control mean.
          Our goal was to test the hypothesis that storms spending more time near the edge of the ice sheet would be associated with greater sea ice loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          The poster distills a large modeling workflow into a format accessible to a mixed audience of faculty, students, and visitors.
          It combines cyclone path maps, time series of sea ice concentration differences, and spatial difference maps around storm dates, along with text that explains methods, results, limitations, and future directions.
          Designing the poster required careful decisions about which figures to foreground, how much text to include, and how to keep the focus on the research questions rather than on every technical detail.
        </p>

        <h2>What this artifact reveals</h2>
        <p>
          This artifact highlights my ability to work within a research team and to communicate computational science visually.
          I contributed to data analysis, interpretation of the sea ice response to different storm tracks, and the wording of the abstract and discussion.
          The poster shows that I can help translate complex model output into a narrative about climate processes, which is a different but related skill compared to the security work highlighted in my other artifacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also reflects my awareness of responsibility and impact.
          Climate modeling work has clear societal implications, and our team took care to avoid overstating conclusions while still explaining why storm location relative to the ice edge might matter for Arctic sea ice vulnerability.
          This balance between accuracy and accessibility is a communication skill that I aim to carry into future projects, especially when I discuss security risks and research findings with broader audiences.
