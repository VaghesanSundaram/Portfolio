      <h1>Elliptic Curve Cryptography</h1>
      <p>
        A discrete mathematics paper that introduces elliptic curves, point operations, and the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman key exchange, with discussion of security and future threats.

        <p>
          I wrote this paper for a high school discrete math course to explain how elliptic curve cryptography can be used to establish a shared secret between two parties.
          Starting from the definition of elliptic curves and the basic point operations of negation, addition, doubling, and scalar multiplication, I built up to the notion of domain parameters over finite fields and the key exchange protocol.
          The paper walks through how parties choose private keys, derive public keys by multiplying a generator point, and arrive at the same shared point on the curve without revealing their private scalars.

          My purpose was to demystify ECC for readers who were comfortable with algebra but new to modern public key systems.
          I chose to emphasize geometric intuition alongside modular arithmetic, and I framed the discussion around the hardness of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem.
          I also briefly addressed the impact of quantum computing and concerns about backdoored curves, positioning ECC in a broader security landscape rather than treating it as a purely theoretical topic.

        <p>
          This artifact reflects my early interest in cryptography and my desire to connect mathematical definitions to real security protocols.
          It shows that I can explain a multi step algorithm with careful definitions, examples, and a clear narrative about why the scheme is believed to be secure.
          The discussion section reveals my instinct to think beyond the textbook, considering quantum attacks and curve selection as part of the threat model.

          In the context of this portfolio, the ECC paper bridges my mathematical training and my cybersecurity ambitions.
          It demonstrates integrity and precision in explaining a protocol that underpins many real world systems, and it foreshadows the kind of work I hope to do in applied cryptography and vulnerability analysis.
          The experience of writing this piece made it easier to approach more advanced security topics at UMD, since I already had practice turning formal definitions into accessible explanations.
