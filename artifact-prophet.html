          Prophet is a hackathon project that I built with teammates to explore how prediction markets, blockchain infrastructure, and AI models could inform each other.
          The core idea was to create a platform where users could create markets on real world events, place trades through Solana smart contracts, and surface higher quality forecasts by layering AI tools over user generated data.
          We implemented the system in a compressed timeline, coordinating backend services, contract logic, and a front end interface so that the demo could support end to end workflows of creating and resolving markets.

        <p>
          This artifact matters to my portfolio because it shows how I approach ambitious, open ended problems under time pressure.
          Instead of treating the project as a pure coding exercise, I had to think about threat models, user incentives, data sources, and on chain constraints at the same time.
          It also pushed me to practice technical communication: scoping features with teammates, writing clear documentation, and explaining our architecture to judges with different technical backgrounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Working on Prophet highlights my persistence in dealing with complex systems and my willingness to learn across layers of the stack.
          I had to debug smart contract issues, coordinate off chain services, and reason about how prediction logic and liquidity mechanisms would affect user behavior.
          That experience reinforced the value of perseverance when there is no single right answer and when each design choice introduces its own tradeoffs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project also reflects my commitment to clear technical communication.
          We could have settled for a basic proof of concept, but our team kept refining the user flow, tightening the architecture, and clarifying the story we wanted to tell.
          Prophet therefore represents not only my technical interests in decentralized systems and AI, but also my growth in presenting complex ideas clearly to a nontrivial audience under constraints.
