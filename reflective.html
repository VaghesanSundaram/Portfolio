      <h1>Reflective essay</h1>
      <p>
        This essay connects the artifacts in my portfolio to my values, my growth as a writer, and my plans for life after UMD.

        When I entered UMD, I knew I wanted to work in cybersecurity, but I did not yet have a clear sense of how writing, collaboration, and reflection would shape that path. Building this portfolio pushed me to look across projects that span blockchain, behavioral biometrics, climate modeling, and mathematical cryptography, and to ask what they say about who I am becoming as a learner and professional. Across these contexts, three values keep showing up: perseverance when problems are messy, a commitment to technical excellence, and clear communication with different audiences.

        The Prophet prediction market and the keystroke dynamics authentication project represent my drive to experiment at the edges of security and emerging technology. In both cases I worked iteratively, debugging infrastructure and refining models until the systems behaved the way we intended. That process required patience through failure and many small design decisions. At the same time, these projects forced me to explain complex systems to teammates and potential users, which made me more intentional about how I structure explanations, justify tradeoffs, and document work.

        The FIRE Climate Computing poster, the eigenfaces paper, and the elliptic curve cryptography paper highlight a different side of my development: the ability to move between technical depth and accessible narrative. In the climate project, our team distilled large CESM outputs into a visual story about Arctic cyclone tracks and sea ice loss. In the eigenfaces and ECC papers, I practiced writing for mathematically informed readers while still grounding each section in clear definitions, examples, and discussion of limitations. Putting these pieces side by side shows me that good technical writing is not just about correctness, but about anticipating reader questions and connecting results back to larger stakes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking ahead, I plan to continue working at the intersection of security, research, and communication. I want to deepen my skills in vulnerability analysis, penetration testing, and applied cryptography, while staying engaged with research communities like FIRE that connect computing to climate and other societal questions. I am proud of the range of artifacts in this portfolio, but I also see areas for growth, especially in collaborating across disciplines and writing for nontechnical stakeholders who make policy or business decisions. As I move toward internships, certifications, and eventually full time roles, I will keep using portfolios like this one to track not only what I can build, but how I explain my work and the values that drive it.
